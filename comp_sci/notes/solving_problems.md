#BEFORE YOU START CODING
  * understand the problem. ask questions or loosely defined or unclear parts. 
  * ask questions such as: "is it safe to assume input is valid" 
  * work through simple examples.
  * make a plan sudo code some high level structure. 
# WHILE YOU CODE. 
  * think out loud. (talk about your code, not what methods to use)
  * Break the problem down. ( use language like in this condition I'll want to do such and such )
  * Delay the implementation of your helper functions. 
    (do helper functions last, explain what they do and return and move on. )
  * Don't get caught up in trivialities. 
    (if you get stuck, explain that you would look up the specifics in the documentation.)
# ONCE YOU HAVE A SOLUTION
  * think about edge cases
  * step through your code.
  * explain the shortcuts you took. 
# talking about time/ space complexity.
  * when saying big O(n) say where n is length of array or length of input.
