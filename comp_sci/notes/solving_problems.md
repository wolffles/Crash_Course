#BEFORE YOU START CODING
  * understand the problem. ask questions or loosely defined or unclear parts. 
  * work through simple examples.
  * make a plan sudo code some high level structure. 
# WHILE YOU CODE. 
  * think out loud. 
  * Break the problem down
  * Delay the implementation of your helper functions. 
    (do helper functions last, explain what they do and return and move on. )
  * Don't get caught up in trivialities. 
    (if you get stuck, explain that you would look up the specifics in the documentation.)
# ONCE YOU HAVE A SOLUTION
  * think about edge cases
  * step through your code.
  * explain the shortcuts you took.
