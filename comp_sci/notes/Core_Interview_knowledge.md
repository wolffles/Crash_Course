# DATA STRUCTURES
  ## Linked Lists
    * linear data structure where each element is a separate object called nodes, each node holds the data and reference to the next node. the last node is usually null.
  ## Tree, Tries, & Graphs
  ### Tree
    * A general data structure of recursive nodes, there are many types of trees popular ones are binary trees, and balanced trees, segment trees, and suffice trees for dictionary look up. 
  ### Tries (digital tree, radix tree, prefix tree)
    * usually used for dictionary look ups. no node in the tree stores a key associated with the node. in other words its really just decendents of the previous node. such that values are either added on or taken away with each progression in the tree. 
  ### Graphs
    * is a non linear data structure where each element is called node or vertice, and the lines connecting them are called edges or arcs.
  ## Stacks & Queues
  ### Stacks
    * A stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added. In stack both the operations of push and pop takes place at the same end that is top of the stack. It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.
  ### Queues
    * A Queue or FIFO is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, two operations are enqueue like push, and dequeue is like shift. 
  ## Heaps
    * heaps are a complete binary tree(all nodes are filled except possibly the last, where all nodes are left as possible.). they usually come in min or max where the root is the min or max. 
  ## Vectors / ArraysList
    * array lists are multi threaded meaning multiple operations can occur at a time. asynchronously. 
    * vectors are single threaded meaning single operations can occur at a time. synchronous
  ## Hash Tables
# ALGORITHMS
  ## Breadth-First Search
    searches in layers root, 2nd nodes, 3rd nodes, and so on. 
  ## Depth-first Search
    searches left first and bubbles up taking the first right, then recurse. 
  ## Binary Search
    needs to be sorted. comparison search that checks the middle value and if -1 left,  +1 right.
