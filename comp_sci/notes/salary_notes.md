I might be able to offer some advice... I run a llc that does independent contracting and per project the rate can vary. It could be a fixed project fee, hourly rate or retainer fee -- whatever you choose should be dependent on the project.

If you feel the engagement is a long-term engagement, probably a retainer would be ideal to give a guarantee to the client/customer that you can work X amount of hours.

if the engagement is a short term, then fixed fee or hourly rate is more appropriate, the former being more preferred by customers as they typically have a price/budget ceiling.

here's a tip in pricing your hourly rate: imagine what your yearly salary would be doing that kind of job. then figure out what the per/hour cost is that would equate to the yearly salary.

now that you have a hourly rate, you can adjust based on how many hours required for the project, maintenance and/or expenses, etc

however, definitely advise to do some market research to see what market rates are for your type of work. sometimes, your "desired salary" might not always match with what the market prices you at. so adjust your expectations based on market rates and scale appropriately
