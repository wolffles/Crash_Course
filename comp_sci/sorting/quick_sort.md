# QUICKSORT
## KEY FACTS
  * pivot points, creating multiple sub arrays, recursive
  * Î˜(n log(n))
  
## EXPLAINATION
  Quicksort starts with an arbitrary pivot point then iterates through the array comparing the elements with the pivot point. switching elements that are less thanthe pivot point to one side and greater to the other. two subarrays which then can recurse until the array is sorted.
